# Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio.
My name is Kobie Magana. As of December 14th, 2024, I will have earned
my Bachelors' Degrees in both `Computer Science` and **Kinesiology** from Bradley University.
Why both? I realized nearing the end of my Kinesiology degree,
that I would be pigeon-holing myself into earning a Doctorate in Physical Therapy. After some 
soul searching from working as a Rehab Tech for a few months and Covid-19, I realized there is more
opportunity to try something else before my time in undergrad was up.

So, in my last semester as a Kinesiology major, I took a leap and enrolled into a CS 101 course at Bradley. Turns out
I could also find enjoyment in the field of computer science. Fast forward two years and I will be obtaining both
degrees in fields I enjoy. 

I appreciate you for taking the time to read my summary!
