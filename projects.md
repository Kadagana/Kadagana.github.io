# My Projects
## Teamstream
Project boards, such as TeamWork, provide a great way for organizations to assign tasks and track time
to specific projects. The only issue was a lack of ability to see assigned tasks by person, as opposed to project.
The solution was Teamstream. Users have the ability to select the name of the person they would like to see tickets for, separated
by column type, such as To-Do, In Progress, In QA, Complete, etc. 

Seeing tasks by users provided a faster way to quickly see all of your tickets you have been assigned to, thus allowing
for an easier to manage workflow.

Learning the basics of the TeamWork web API was crucial to completing the project. Many back and forth API requests were made using Postman in order to gain
a full of understanding of the JSONs being returned.

## Moment Workout  
<a class="btn" href="https://github.com/Kadagana/moment-workout" target="_blank">View Repository</a>

Tailored to my workout preferences, I created a local app using React Native
that would track sets per week per muscle group.
It taught me some of the quirks of React Native while
allowing me to incorporate features based on my own knowledge from exercise science.

## Caracal News Database 
<a class="btn" href="https://github.com/kmagana5/CS370Project" target="_blank">View Repository</a>

An admin panel for a made up news organization about caracals.
Using PHP and MySQL, my team and created a database schema that would allow
us to import unnormalized data about stories, users, subscribers and more into a
locally hosted MySQL server. It taught me how to style some basic pages using Bootstrap.

## Caterpillar 3D Printing Marketplace Storefront  
<a class="btn" href="https://github.com/kmagana5/Course-Project-2" target="_blank">View Repository</a>

As a final project for a software development course,
our class partnered with caterpillar to design and incorporate a functional
storefront for their prospective 3D printing marketplace. Using the
MERN stack, it was my first introduction to non-relational databases,
React, and an express.js backend. I was designated team leader for this project
due to my experience at GoodJava, Inc.
