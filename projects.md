# My Projects

## [Moment Workout](https://github.com/Kadagana/moment-workout)
Tailored to my workout preferences, I created a local app using React Native
that would track sets per week per muscle group.
It taught me some of the quirks of React Native while
allowing me to incorporate features based on my own knowledge from exercise science.

## [Caracal News Database](https://github.com/kmagana5/CS370Project)
An admin panel for a made up news organization about caracals.
Using PHP and MySQL, my team and created a database schema that would allow
us to import unnormalized data about stories, users, subscribers and more into a
locally hosted hosted MySQL server. It taught me how to style some basic pages using Bootstrap.

## [Caterpillar 3D Printing Marketplace Storefront](https://github.com/kmagana5/Course-Project-2)
As a final project for a software development course,
our class partnered with caterpillar to design and incorporate a functional
storefront for their prospective 3D printing marketplace. Using the
MERN stack, it was my first introduction to non-relational databases,
React, and an express.js backend. I was designated team leader for this project
due to my experience at GoodJava, Inc.
